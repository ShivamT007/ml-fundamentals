## Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a field of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. 

It can be broadly divided into three main categories:
- Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for tasks such as classification (predicting categories, e.g., spam detection) and regression (predicting continuous values, e.g., house prices). 
- Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data to uncover hidden structures, with clustering being a common approach to group similar items, such as customer segmentation. 
- Reinforcement learning focuses on agents that learn by interacting with an environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards to optimize decision-making, such as in robotics or game playing. 

For each of these approaches, dedicated notebooks will provide both theoretical foundations and practical use cases, guiding you through real-world scenarios and demonstrating how to tackle them effectively.
