    "## What is Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is a fundamental statistical and machine learning technique used to model and analyze the relationship between a dependent variable (_target_) and one or more independent variables (_features_). It helps us understand how the typical value of the dependent variable changes when any one of the independent variables is varied.\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps us answer 2 types of questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explanatory: How does size, location, and age of a house affect its price?\n",
    "- Predictive: Given the size, location, and age of a house, what is its likely price?\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the above example to explain how it works. Our aim is to predict the price of a house based on its size, location, and age. To achieve this with regression, we would typically follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prepare examples of the thing we want to understand: In the above example, it would be a dataset of houses with their sizes, locations, ages, and prices.\n",

    "  - Take in the dataset\n",
    "  - Analyze the relationships between the input variables: size, location, age and what we want to predict: price\n",
    "  - Create a mathematical model (an equation) that can take in the input variables and come up with an estimation of the price, so that the estimated price is as close as possible to the actual price in the dataset.\n",

By understanding how changes in independent variables affect the dependent variable, we can optimize outcomes, allocate resources effectively, and identify key factors driving trends.
