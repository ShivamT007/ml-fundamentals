    "## What is Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is a fundamental statistical and machine learning technique used to model and analyze the relationship between a dependent variable (_target_) and one or more independent variables (_features_). It helps us understand how the typical value of the dependent variable changes when any one of the independent variables is varied.\n",

    "## Types of Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of regression techniques, each suited for different scenarios:\n",

    "- **Linear Regression:** Models the relationship between two variables by fitting a straight line. Useful for simple, linear relationships.\n",
    "- **Multiple Linear Regression:** Extends linear regression to multiple features.\n",
    "- **Polynomial Regression:** Models non-linear relationships by fitting a polynomial curve.\n",
    "- **Regularized Regression (Ridge, Lasso):** Adds penalties to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression:** Used for predicting categories (e.g., success or failure), not continuous values.\n",
