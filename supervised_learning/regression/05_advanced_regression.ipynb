    "\n",
    "1. **Non-linear Relationships**: sales might depend on complex interactions between features\n",
    "   - Example: High-priced items might sell differently across branches\n",
    "   - Customer type + product line combinations might have unique patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Interactions**: real-world sales involve feature combinations\n",
    "   - Weekend + certain product lines = higher sales\n",
    "   - Gender + product preferences = complex buying patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Complex Business Logic**: supermarket sales involve:\n",

    "* **Standard scaling:** $X_{scaled} = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}$ where $\\mu$ is the mean and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation\n",
