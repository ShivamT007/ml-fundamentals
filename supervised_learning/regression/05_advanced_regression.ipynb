    "\n",
    "In our previous notebooks, we discovered that **linear models had high MSE on both training and test sets**, indicating **underfitting**. This suggests our supermarket sales data has complex patterns that linear models cannot capture effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why linear models fall short:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-linear Relationships**: sales might depend on complex interactions between features\n",
    "   - Example: High-priced items might sell differently across branches\n",
    "   - Customer type + product line combinations might have unique patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Interactions**: real-world sales involve feature combinations\n",
    "   - Weekend + certain product lines = higher sales\n",
    "   - Gender + product preferences = complex buying patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Complex Business Logic**: supermarket sales involve:\n",
    "   - Seasonal patterns, customer behavior, location effects\n",
    "   - Price sensitivity varies by product category\n",
    "   - Branch-specific customer preferences\n",

    "\n",
    "Regularization techniques help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the regression model. This is especially useful when dealing with many features, our model is overfitting or multicollinearity. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ridge Regression:** Adds L2 penalty (squared magnitude of coefficients). L2 penalty shrinks the coefficients of the variables, but never makes them zero (disappear completely from the quation). It keeps all features but reduces their influence, spreading effects more evenly.\n",
    "- **Lasso Regression:** Adds L1 penalty (absolute value of coefficients), can shrink some coefficients to zero (feature selection). L1, on the other hand, pushes some coefficients to zero. It does automatically variable sleection and keeps only the most important independent variables in the final equation. In machine learning we say that L1 does _feature (or variable) selection_\n",

    "What is overfitting?\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "        <summary>Answer: Click to show</summary>\n",
    "    Opposite to underfitting, overfitting happens when a model learns not only the true pattern in the trainnig data, but also random fluctuations. As a result, it performs (too) well on the training set but poorly on unseen test data because it fails to generalize.\n",

    "What is multicollinearity?\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "        <summary>Answer: Click to show</summary>\n",
    "    This occurs when two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated with each other. It makes it hard for the model to distinguish their individual effects on the dependent variable, leading to unstable coefficients and unreliable interpretations. In short, predictors overlap too much and confuse the model.\n",
